## Nürnberg Digital Festival Hackathon Health | HackBay
Challenge from the Bayerisches Staatsministerium für Gesundheit und Pflege .

## [The Challenge](https://nuernberg.digital/programm-2022/programmuebersicht/details/health-hackday.html?mc_cid=15839485e6&mc_eid=35046091ed)
### The proposed solution
We propose a personalized heath tracker to help users plan their days based on the climate change problems. The app analyses and learns the users behaviour and based on the amount of pollen/heat/UV notifies the user about alternate time for their outdoor plans. 

## How to use

Clone the repo
`https://github.com/antaradas94/klimawanderer.git`

Then do the following to install the packages.

```
cd klimawanderer
poetry install
```
